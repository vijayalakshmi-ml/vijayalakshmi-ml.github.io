Welcome to my blog.

I'm Vijayalakshmi Manikandan. Currently working as a Senior Software engineer at BenchSci. 

I'm in the final phase of my MS degree in Information Systems(focus on AI/NLP). Currently, I'm conducting research for my thesis at Athabasca University. 
Recently I received Outstanding Distinction Award üèÖ for Graduate Students with GPA - 4.0. 

On my blog, you'll find a collection of articles exploring the fascinating realms of AI and ML. My mission is simple: to share my ML journey, from experiments and coding adventures to valuable insights and learnings. Join me as we dive deep into the world of machine learning together!
